*Login Page:
-It looks pretty, no idea what this is.  No title.  
-Put copywrite stuff on footer/on the bottom somewhere
-On bottom of login button, link to account sign up
-Also, if account signup is on top left, put it on top right of page.

Signup page:

Profile Page:
  
*Settings Page:
-Padding around white so it looks like it's floating.  Put space between Make User and Delete button.
-Confusing about changing role, look into 'make user' as it seems like it's creating user instead of making user not admin
-BUG: Should not be able to make last admin into user
-Make User and Accept User are two different colors.... Make User is not primary action, so could be a small button under name instead.
-Change Purple button on this page.

*Create Page: 
-this form has no background, but some have white background.  So all should have the same background, Bianca thinks would look better if all forms had white or grey background.
-Create button at bottom is hard to see.

Invetory Page:
-menu on left (filter) looks like unformatted test.  Needs to be more clear it's a menu
-Create New Product link and the actual products look exactly the same, seperate create new product link and links to actually added items.  Could create a plus sign for add button.
-Title for this page, like inventory management, to make it more clear what's going on, what's on the page, what action we need to take.
-Something that shows which filter is active, hard to tell if page is being filtered or not.

Sell Page:
Margins around page, inventory basket is pushed up against left side.

**Add splash page if possible--static page to tell what blyp is, marketing page, which will take you to a login page.  This is a stretch goal but would be cool.

Can put team name, privacy policy on splash page or login page.
